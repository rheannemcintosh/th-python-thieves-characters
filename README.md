# Thieves RPG :oncoming_police_car:

## Project Overview
The Thieves RPG Application is a basic Object Oriented Python application which I created at the start of my Python journey. The application is based off of a Treehouse Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/lets-make-a-class). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Inital Work
The inital work was completed by following along the with the Treehouse tutorial.
